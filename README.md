## 🧠 What is Code & Conquer?

**Code & Conquer** is a **hybrid board game** that combines a **physical game board** with a **fully digital web application**.

Players move real tokens on a physical board and resolve challenges, events, and decisions through **mobile-friendly digital minigames** opened via QR codes or direct interaction.

The goal is to make **algorithmic thinking and data-structure concepts** accessible, social, and fun — without feeling like school or a coding tutorial.

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Loop

1. One player creates a **Match**
2. Other players join via **6-digit code** or **QR**
3. Each player rolls a **D20** to determine turn order  
   - Ties are communicated
   - Tied players re-roll until resolved
4. Players take turns:
   - Roll a **D6**
   - Move their physical token
   - Resolve the landed field digitally
5. Challenges, forks, and special cards affect the match
6. Scores are tracked live
7. The match ends on the final board node → **Endscreen + Leaderboard**
