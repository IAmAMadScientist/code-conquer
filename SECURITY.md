# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the latest `main` branch is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do NOT open a public issue for security-sensitive reports.

Instead, use GitHub Security Advisories:
- Go to the repository → Security → Advisories → “Report a vulnerability”

We will respond as soon as possible and coordinate a fix.
